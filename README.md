# RustiCal

a CalDAV/CardDAV server

> [!WARNING]
> RustiCal is **not production-ready!**
> I'm just starting to use it myself so I cannot guarantee that everything will be working smoothly just yet.
> I hope there won't be any manual migrations anymore but if you want to be an early adopter some SQL knowledge might be useful just in case.
> If you still want to play around with it in its current state, absolutely feel free to do so and to open up an issue if something is not working. :)

## Features

- easy to backup, everything saved in one SQLite database
- [WebDAV Push](https://github.com/bitfireAT/webdav-push/) support, so near-instant synchronisation to DAVx5
- lightweight (the container image contains only one binary)
- adequately fast (I'd love to say blazingly fastâ„¢ :fire: but I don't have any benchmarks)
- deleted calendars are recoverable
- Nextcloud login flow (In DAVx5 you can login through the Nextcloud flow and automatically generate an app token)
- Apple configuration profiles (skip copy-pasting passwords and instead generate the configuration in the frontend)
- OpenID Connect support (with option to disable password login)

## Getting Started
