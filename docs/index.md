# RustiCal

a CalDAV/CardDAV server

!!! warning
RustiCal is **not production-ready!**
I'm just starting to use it myself so I cannot guarantee that everything will be working smoothly just yet.
I hope there won't be any manual migrations anymore but if you want to be an early adopter some SQL knowledge might be useful just in case.
If you still want to play around with it in its current state, absolutely feel free to do so and to open up an issue if something is not working. :)

## Features

- easy to backup, everything saved in one SQLite database
- lightweight (the container image contains only one binary)
- adequately fast (I'd love to say blazingly fastâ„¢ :fire: but I don't have any benchmarks)
- deleted calendars are recoverable
- Nextcloud login flow (In DAVx5 you can login through the Nextcloud flow and automatically generate an app token)
- Apple configuration profiles (skip copy-pasting passwords and instead generate the configuration in the frontend)
- [OpenID Connect](setup/oidc.md) support (with option to disable password login)

## Tested Clients

- DAVx5,
- GNOME Accounts, GNOME Calendar, GNOME Contacts
- Evolution
- Apple Calendar (known issue: If a user is member of multiple groups then Apple Calendar just randomly selects a calendar home)
