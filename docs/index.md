# RustiCal

a CalDAV/CardDAV server

!!! warning
RustiCal is **not production-ready!**
While I've started migrating to RustiCal and becoming more confident,
please know that bugs and rough edges will still occur.
Concretely, if you are using Apple Calendar you will want to stay away from assigning groups to users.
If you still want to play around with it in its current state, absolutely feel free to do so and to open up an issue if something is not working. :)

## Features

- easy to backup, everything saved in one SQLite database
  - also export feature in the frontend
- lightweight (the container image contains only one binary)
- adequately fast (I'd love to say blazingly fastâ„¢ :fire: but I don't have any benchmarks)
- deleted calendars are recoverable
- Nextcloud login flow (In DAVx5 you can login through the Nextcloud flow and automatically generate an app token)
- Apple configuration profiles (skip copy-pasting passwords and instead generate the configuration in the frontend)
- [OpenID Connect](setup/oidc.md) support (with option to disable password login)

## Tested Clients

- DAVx5,
- GNOME Accounts, GNOME Calendar, GNOME Contacts
- Evolution
- Apple Calendar
